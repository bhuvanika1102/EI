# Java Design Patterns and Mini Project

This repository contains two sets of questions implemented in Java.

## Question 1: Design Patterns

### Behavioral Design Patterns

#### 1. Observer Pattern
**Use case:** A weather station that notifies multiple display units about the changes in weather conditions.

#### 2. Strategy Pattern
**Use case:** A payment system that allows users to choose different payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal, Bitcoin).

### Creational Design Patterns

#### 1. Singleton Pattern
**Use case:** A configuration manager that ensures only one instance is used throughout the application.

#### 2. Factory Pattern
**Use case:** A document creator that can generate different types of documents (e.g., Word, PDF, Excel) based on user input.

### Structural Design Patterns

#### 1. Decorator Pattern
**Use case:** A text editor that allows adding features like spell check, grammar check, and auto-complete dynamically.

#### 2. Adapter Pattern
**Use case:** A media player that can play different types of media formats using an adapter.

## Question 2: Mini Project

This section contains a mini project implemented in Java. More details about the mini project can be found in the project folder.
